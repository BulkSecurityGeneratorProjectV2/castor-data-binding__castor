# Castor - Data binding made easy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/castor-data-binding/castor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/castor-data-binding/castor) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.codehaus.castor/castor-xml/badge.png)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.codehaus.castor/castor-xml)

Castor is an open source data binding framework for Java[tm]. It provides direct, short paths 
between Java objects and XML documents. Castor essentially provides Java-to-XML binding and more.

Project documentation:

The persistence part of Castor has been migrated to a separate git repository, available at https://github.com/castor-data-binding/castor-jdo.git.
