# Download project binaries

If you are not using Maven as build too, you can still get the binary JARs for a particular release in form of a binary distribution.

Please browse to [Sonatype's OSS repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/codehaus/castor/castor-distribution) or [Sonatype's OSS snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/codehaus/castor/castor-distribution/), select 
the required (snapshot) release and download one of the available distributions:

* Castor XML binaries only (named castor-distribution-x.y.z-xml-bin.zip)
* Castor XML binaries with dependencies (e.g. castor-distribution-x.y.z-xml-bin-with-dependencies.zip)

or 

* Castor Codegen binaries only (named castor-distribution-x.y.z-codegen-bin.zip)
* Castor Codegen binaries with dependencies (e.g. castor-distribution-x.y.z-codegen-bin-with-dependencies.zip)
