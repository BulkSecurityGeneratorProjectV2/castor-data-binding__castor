# Download project binaries

If you are not using Maven as build too, you can still get the binary JARs for a particular release in form of a binary distribution.

Please browse to [Sonatype's OSS repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/codehaus/castor/castor-distribution), select 
the required release version and download one of the available distributions:

* Castor binaries only (named distribution-x.y.z-bin.zip)
* Castor binaries with dependencies (e.g. distribution-x.y.z-bin-with-dependencies.zip)
